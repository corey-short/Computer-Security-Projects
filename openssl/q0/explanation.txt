**** q0 Explanation ****

a) A description of the procedure you used to obtain the secret.

We inserted the private key into Wireshark to decrypt the packets. After that, discovering
the secret was simple because we immediately noticed a HTTP GET to /secret.html. We looked at
the response in packet 12 and noticed our secret had been sent back as plaintext.


b) A list of cryptographic algorithms that were used for this TLS connection. For
each algorithm, describe in one sentence its use in the protocol.

1. TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA         - 256 bit encryption 
2. TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA    -  
3. TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
4. TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA         - 128 bit encryption
5. TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA
6. TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV


c) A discussion of whether there was any technical way by which you could have
been prevented from decrypting the conversation even though you have ob-
tained the private key. If so, briefly describe the technical approach. If not,
explain why no such approach is feasible.

The private key needs to be kept a secret for a reason. If someone is able to discover your
private key then they are able to see decrypt all communication between the user in this
cryptography scheme.
