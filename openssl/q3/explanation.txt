a) I obtained the governor's password by spoofing the certificate of digipwntar and redirecting to my local server packets from the governor that were directed at email.gov-of-caltopia.info. I created a new private key and request and passed in both as arguments for the sign executable, which uses the root CA private key to create spoofed certificates. While creating the fake certificate, I copied the credentials of 01.pem, the digipwntar certificate. I modified pcap_tool.py such that the handle_pkt function would intercept any packet with 8.8.8.8 as the destination IP address and email.gov-of-caltopia.info as the domain name of the request. For each such packet, the handle_pkt function would send a packet with the source and destination IP addresses reversed, the UDP source and destination ports reversed, etc. I launched the local server, ran the Python script, and opened the governor's browser, and I was thus able to access the governor's credentials.

b) The governor could defend against my attack by installing a firewall that would detect my spoofed certificate.
