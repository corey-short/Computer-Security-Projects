So to start off you start the VM.
Then on your local terminal you check which ip are open and can be scanned.
	ifconfig
This will show: 
	vboxnet0: flags=8943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
		ether 0a:00:27:00:00:00 
		inet 192.168.56.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.56.255 
With the inet IP address 192.168.56.1 you are going to do a subnet mask scan. 
	nmap 192.168.56.1/24
This will show an open port and the IP address that you are going to use to get into the VM
	192.168.56.101 open 
	21/tcp open  ftp
Then you use netcat
	nc 192.168.56.101 21
This will show the welcome message and you type
	USER dana:)
	PASS whatever
Then you can type 
	nc 192.168.56.101 6200
Which will give you entrance into the VM. 
Then you can ls and see which directories are there and start and exploiting it.
